## Overview

You will create visualizations using techniques from previous labs and present them on a portfolio page in a public Github repository. Ideally, you will use the same geographic area for these visualizations and use each one to elaborate on a theme or topic. Ultimately, your page should tell a story. Is that story about your technical expertise in mapping or about the area you show? Maybe it's both.

## Final page

We'll start with the page you made in the *lesson-map* folder (finish the lesson, obviously). You should have a Cesium Ion Story that explores a point cloud. That's your first visualization. Assemble and present at least two additional maps (or animations) on this page. This page must contain a few sections in addition to your visualizations. The exact presentation is up to you, but at the minimum the content should be typo-free, grammatically correct, and provide links to your sources of information. Make sure to complete the following steps.

### Step 1: Create a new repository (1 pt)

Similar to previous labs, create a new repository for your project, add `boydx` as a collaborator, and enable GitHub Pages. Choose a good name that reflects the goal of your page. Your public URL will be: `https://{user-name}.github.io/{repo-name}/`. 

### Step 2: Copy content into new repository

Copy the *index.html* and all associated resource files (maps, PDFs, etc.)  from the *lesson-map* folder and place them inside the new repo's folder. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub. Remember: No files should be over 20 MB in size on GitHub.

### Step 3: Create web page content (8 pts)

Open the *new* repo's *index.html* in VS Code, use the prompts for each of the following bullet items to enter the appropriate content. 

Add:

* Two additional visualizations created from previous module techniques, each with a caption briefly explaining the content. Make preview images of your maps with links to higher resolution versions. For animations, use the embed code provided by the streaming service (similar to how we added the Cesium Ion Story in the lesson). (4 pts)
* A short paragraph about your area(s) of interest, e.g., when was it established/created, where is it, what is unique about it, etc. Story time! (1.5 pts)
* A statement about the goals of the project, e.g., "This project measures and visualizes the historic entrance to Mammoth Cave and demonstrates the use of point clouds in GIS." (1.5 pts)
* A description of the sources and tools used to make the maps. For example, "The maps were created using ArcGIS Pro, ArcPy, and Cesium Ion." List data sources with appropriate links. (0.5 pt)
* A statement about the class, author (you), and date of analysis. (0.5 pt)
* Anything else that helps your visitor better understand your project, e.g., photographs of your area of interest, each with a caption briefly explaining the content.

### Step 4: Publish your page and submit  (1 pt)

Commit and push your final project to your *new* repository. Submit the map URL to Canvas, e.g., `https://{user-name}.github.io/{repo-name}/`.

## Example portfolio pages

Here are a few pages that show how to present your content in HTML. They show more than the minimum project requirements.

* UKy Campus [page](https://boydx.github.io/uky-campus) | [repo](https://github.com/boydx/uky-campus) (spring 2023) 
* Go See Trees [page](https://boydx.github.io/go-see-trees/) | [repo](https://github.com/boydx/go-see-trees/) (spring 2021) 
* Mammoth Cave Historic Entrance [page](https://ionajo.github.io/maca/) | [repo](https://github.com/ionajo/maca/) (fall 2019)
